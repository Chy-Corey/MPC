% MSS Path Update Script
% This script checks for the presence of the 'MSS' directory on MATLAB's 
% path. If found, it removes all existing instances of this path and its 
% subdirectories and then reinstalls them to ensure the path includes all 
% current subdirectories. This is useful for situations where the directory 
% structure of 'MSS' may change due to updates or modifications in the 
% file system.
%
% Usage:
% - Run this script to refresh the MATLAB path entries related to the
%   'MSS' directory.
% - It handles multiple instances of 'MSS' directories by using the
%   first found.
% - It temporarily suppresses and then restores warnings related to 
%   non-existent path entries to prevent clutter in the command window.
